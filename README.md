# Unsupervised Learning Algorithms: A Hands-On Exploration

This project explores different unsupervised learning algorithms by applying dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques on two different datasets. 

## Datasets

The two datasets used in this project are:

1. **[Heart Disease Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease)**

2. **[Diabetic Disease Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetic+Retinopathy+Debrecen+Data+Set)**
## Algorithms

The following unsupervised learning algorithms were used in this project:

1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
2. **Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)**
3. **ICA**
4. **Randomized Projections (RP)**
5. **t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**
6. **Gaussian Mixture clustering**:  
7. **K-means clustering**: 


## Results

The results of applying these algorithms on the two datasets are discussed in the file 'analysis.pdf'
